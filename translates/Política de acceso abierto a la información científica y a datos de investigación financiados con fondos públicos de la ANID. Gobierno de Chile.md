## Open Access Policy to Scientific Information and Research Data Financed with Public Funds from ANID

### Introduction

The scientific information and the open access movement: Designing public policies that guarantee access to publications generated with public funds is one of the topics that dominate the agenda of organizations financing science, technology, and innovation (CTI) activities today. It is not a trivial matter: scientific information is part of the enabling infrastructure for research in all disciplines, and countries allocate large sums to meet the demand of their communities due to the particular oligopolistic organization of commercial publishers and a growing tendency to dominate the entire scientific communication production chain.[^1]

From 1999, with the Budapest Declaration,[^2] and through the launch of Plan S by eleven funding agencies of the European Union in September 2018, open access (OA) to scientific publications continues to be a subject of intense debate. The free circulation of new knowledge, mostly financed with public resources, faces a market where this knowledge is traded like any other good or service; with the particularity that publishers show profit margins above the average of any industry and have distorted many open access initiatives by charging a fee to authors (the so-called Article Processing Charge, APC) that allows the article to be available from the moment of its publication. However, it has not been possible to make industry costs transparent, making this form of OA called the “golden route” functional to the business models of large publishers.[^3] 

A response to reduce the asymmetries faced by people and institutions wishing to access scientific literature is public funding of electronic subscriptions. Examples of these initiatives are scattered throughout the continent: in Brazil, Capes (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), an entity dependent on the Ministry of Education, manages the Journal Portal; in Argentina, the "Electronic Library" depends on the recently restored Ministry of Science, Technology, and Productive Innovation; in Mexico, the National Council of Science and Technology, Conacyt, manages the National Consortium of Scientific and Technological Information Resources, Conricyt; and in Uruguay, the Timbó Portal (Interinstitutional and Multidisciplinary Online Bibliography Network) is an initiative of the National Agency for Research and Innovation, ANII. Other associative forms are verified when libraries come together to create a de facto purchasing power, as in Peru (Consorcio Altamira), in Colombia (the association between ASCUN and the company Publiciencia to create Consortia), and in Paraguay (the association of ONCYT with EBSCO), or when the service is outsourced as happens in Ecuador with the CEDIA Corporation or in Chile with the Cincel Corporation. 

In May 2019, the countries that are part of the LA Referencia Governing Council[^4] published the document "Academic Communication and Open Access: Actions for a Public Policy in Latin America". This contains a set of guidelines to ensure open access (OA), exhibiting a solid tradition in the region with collaborative and non-commercial initiatives such as SciELO, Latindex, CLACSO, and REDALYC, where universities and public agencies have played leading roles. These guidelines aim for open access to be strengthened in the region with specific measures because, unlike in Europe or the United States, "a significant part of public bodies controls various aspects of the value chain (promotion and policies of OA in their country, funding of R&D, infrastructures and OA services, purchases of services from commercial publishers, evaluation and indicators, among others)",[^5] which allows countries in the region, including Chile, to design and implement robust initiatives that ensure open access to publications and scientific data.

### Chile and Public Open Access Policies

The creation and implementation of the National Agency for Research and Development, ANID, responds largely to the evolution of our Science, Technology, Knowledge, and Innovation System and its stage of maturity. This maturity involves rethinking the Agency's role in relation to the administration and use of the knowledge generated with the public funds awarded and, on that basis, generating the mechanisms and instruments that allow greater access and benefit for the whole society.[^6]

Starting from the principle that all knowledge generated with public funds should bring benefits to society and, consequently, be available for use; ANID has developed an open access policy to scientific information and research data financed by the Agency with public funds. We understand that the duty of making this knowledge available is the counterpart of society's right to benefit from what it has financed. Such knowledge, made available to citizens, helps accelerate innovation processes in different productive circuits and improve the quality of life for everyone. Based on these principles, this policy aims to be a course of action that is constantly reviewed and that allows, progressively, to move towards a transparent and open system, where access, reuse, and the constant offer of new information and scientific data contribute in a real and concrete way to the social, cultural, scientific, and economic development of Chile. Moreover, although Chile is a leader in citations per document at the Latin American level, its global scientific production is scarce, making it a net consumer of scientific literature.[^7] This implies that policies promoting open access must be accompanied by others ensuring access to that part of the scientific literature that will continue to be behind paywalls. This is while mandates such as “Plan S” currently promoted in the European Union[^8] and which in the medium term could ensure an increasing percentage of scientific literature accessible for free, are not extended.

### Background of the Policy

The management of scientific information is not alien to ANID's operations.[^9] As the successor of Conicyt, the Agency was born with installed capabilities in scientific information and intervenes in the scientific communication circuit with a series of initiatives, among which the Scientific Publication Support Fund, created in 1988 and still in force; the implementation of the Chilean node of the Scientific Electronic Library Online, SciELO, in 1998, which encouraged the use of electronic formats for scientific editing, also including an editing methodology and a web platform for indexing, searching, and bibliometric indicators; the launch of the BEIC Program in 2008 to ensure the community's access to international publications[^10] and the Scientific Production Repository in 2012 to provide an electronic space that houses all the results financed by the Agency with a view to their dissemination, visibility, and preservation.

As a result of these initiatives, it is possible today to characterize our system based on the following points:
- 25% of the production (understood as articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals) is already in open access when published in SciELO-Chile indexed journals or others. The early insertion of SciELO as a publication and indexing standard explains that percentage.[^11]
- ANID has a program for acquiring high-cost information resources initiated in 2008 (BEIC Program), which ensures free access to a set of journals – the vast majority of the mainstream[^12] – for members of 97 institutions (47 universities, 33 public services, two professional institutes, and 15 research centers).
- International collaboration in scientific communication is a historical trend in Chile, meaning that national researchers are part of cross-border teams to ensure the relevance and impact of research.[^13] This has positive and negative externalities. The positive ones have to do with visibility and belonging to research teams that are at the frontier of knowledge. The negative ones are related to the leadership of researchers in these teams and the relevance or not of the research lines concerning national needs.
- There are monetary incentives for publication included in the legal mechanisms for allocating public funds to universities, which also bring positive and negative externalities. A positive one is that it forces authors to publish in indexed journals to ensure visibility, impact, and monetary return to their home institutions. A negative one is that the "quality" of the research is assimilated to the impact factor of the journal where it is published, which ends up distorting the communication system and the incentive.[^14]

In this context, the main axes of the national scientific information ecosystem are the open access initiatives of scientific and/or academic journals, such as SciELO-Chile, academic or institutional repositories, and the Electronic Library of Scientific Information, BEIC, an information access infrastructure. These axes must be articulated under a single policy or view that allows generating positive externalities ranging from economies of scale, strengthening scientific production, visibility, transparency, and integrity of research, and ensuring citizen access. Finally, it is relevant to highlight that the ongoing initiatives do not address the needs of access and availability of scientific data, understood as all those generated throughout the development of a research project, with or without treatment, and that support the results.

### Policy Objective

This public policy aims to ensure the availability of scientific knowledge contained in publications resulting from the execution of research projects financed with public resources. The results also covered by this public open access policy include theses prepared within the framework of scholarship programs and research data. Meeting this objective will allow the traceability of the results obtained by the initiatives financed by the Agency and will provide the possibility of promoting the use of new knowledge by the scientific community, civil society, the State, industry, and the general public.

### Specific Objectives

- Ensure citizens access to scientific knowledge contained in publications resulting from research projects and postgraduate theses financed by the Agency.
- Promote broad and public scrutiny of the results obtained by the research projects financed by the Agency.
- Facilitate the reuse of information and research data through interoperability standards to generate new knowledge.[^15]

### Policy Phases and Expected Impact

The open access policy defined by the Agency consists of two phases.
For publications, the first phase follows the Green Route model,[^16] aligned with the guidelines agreed upon by the National Science and Technology Organizations (ONCYT) of the region participating in the Federated Network of Institutional Repositories of Scientific Publications, also known as “LA Referencia”[^17] of which ANID is a founding member.[^18]
For data, the policy will generally be based on the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability):[^19]
- Findable: use of persistent identifiers, use of enriched metadata, registration in search engines.
- Accessible: recovery by identifiers using open, free, and implementable protocols and standards.
- Interoperable: formal, accessible, and shared representation language.
- Reusable: clear and visible usage licenses, information on the origin of the data, the standards used in their collection, the authors, etc.

This first phase also aims, within two years from the entry into force of the Open Access Policy, to collect enough background information on the use of information and data, the costs associated with their management, and the expenses currently incurred by researchers for publishing. If the evidence collected in this first phase so advises, it will be possible to move towards the second phase, which will consist of implementing for publications the so-called “Golden Route,”[^20] which would eliminate the embargo periods of the Green Route and make the publications immediately available in open access by paying a fee to the publishers.

### Policy

ANID's open access policy is based on the principle that all knowledge generated with public funds should benefit society and be available for use, as it is understood that the duty of availability of this knowledge is the counterpart of society's right to benefit from what it has financed. Such knowledge, made available to citizens, contributes to accelerating innovation processes in different productive circuits and improving the quality of life for everyone.

#### 1. General Provisions

Every project financed wholly or partially through instruments of the National Agency for Research and Development, ANID, that has among its expected results the generation of documents and/or publications and/or research data, must consider the necessary mechanisms to manage open access to such documents, publications, and data in accordance with this policy.

#### 2. Definitions

- **Instruments**: Includes all grants administered by the National Agency for Research and Development, including scholarships in any of their modalities.
- **Agreement**: Document signed by the Legal Representative of the National Agency for Research and Development and the beneficiary (natural or legal person) that formalizes the allocation of resources by ANID to the latter for the development of the previously approved research project or the assigned scholarship, and establishes the conditions and obligations of the parties.
- **Results**: all documents and/or research data produced throughout the research or obtaining a scholarship and containing the findings and new knowledge obtained.
- **Open Access**: for the purposes of this policy, it will be understood as the deposit in universal access repositories – and without any restrictions – of digital copies of documents, publications, and scientific data published in journals, books, monographs, or other physical or digital media considered as results of ANID-funded research.
- **Research Data**: all those generated throughout the development of the research project, with or without treatment, and that support the research results. This set includes personal data, which must be treated following current regulatory and legal provisions for their proper protection.
- **Publications**: The scientific and technological production affected by these provisions will include the set of journal articles, book chapters, books, technical-scientific works, academic theses, among others, that are the result of activities funded by ANID and have gone through a formal evaluation process, whether published or not.
- **Green Open Access Route**: the process by which the author who has published their article in a subscription journal deposits the accepted version (Accepted Manuscript, AM) on a website or in an institutional or thematic repository after an embargo period from the article's publication date in a journal, usually lasting between 6 and 24 months.
- **Golden Open Access Route**: implies public, immediate, permanent, and free access to the final article. This is achieved by paying a variable fee known as APC (Article Publishing Charge), which are the costs derived from the review, production, and publication process of the article.
- **Metadata**: consist of information that characterizes the data. They describe the content, quality, conditions, history, availability, and other characteristics of the data. For example, a library catalog or a bibliographic record are metadata.

#### 3. Management and Implementation

The Sub-directorate of Networks, Strategy, and Knowledge (REC) of ANID will be responsible for designing and implementing all necessary mechanisms to ensure compliance with this policy, guiding researchers regarding it, indexing deposited publications, and promoting the search and retrieval of content.
It must:

1. Promote, consolidate, articulate, and disseminate the ANID Scientific Production Repository.
2. Establish and update the interoperability standards with which the Scientific Production Repository operates and disseminate them to other institutions managing similar repositories.
3. Establish interoperability standards for research data and guidelines for selecting reliable repositories that can be used in compliance with this policy.
4. Implement the necessary mechanisms for applying this open access policy.
5. Agree with publishers on collaboration mechanisms for the proper compliance with this policy by authors who have received Agency grants.
6. Define communication mechanisms and deadlines for complying with the obligations contained in this open access policy, which will be included in the terms document of each Agency instrument.

### 4. Open Access Provisions for Scientific Information

All beneficiaries (researchers and institutions receiving direct or indirect ANID funding) of instruments with current agreements with the National Agency for Research and Development, ANID, must deposit a machine-readable electronic copy[^21] of the final version of their scientific production published or approved by a competent authority or with jurisdiction in the matter in the ANID Scientific Production Repository within six months from the date of official publication or approval, to make this information available in open access. To this end, the following provisions will apply:

- ANID will prepare a summary document with the main guidelines of this policy, which will be available for authors to present to publishers when signing the publication contract to facilitate compliance with these provisions.
- This policy will use the controlled vocabulary developed by the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) to define the different versions of document types subject to mandatory deposit.[^22]
- In the case of articles to be published in scientific journals, authors may use different options to ensure that at least one machine-readable electronic copy of the Accepted Manuscript is deposited in the ANID Scientific Production Repository, without interfering with their publication options.
- For the final article, it is the author's obligation to inform the ANID counterpart of the embargo period affecting their publication, if any, and to provide ANID with the DOI of the article for proper identification and retrieval.
- Articles published in SciELO-Chile or SciELO network journals do not need to be deposited in the Scientific Production Repository, although the author must inform the ANID counterpart of the publication's DOI within 30 business days after the publication date of their article.
- Manuscripts whose publication would be contrary to Law No. 19.628 on the protection of private life, are subject to a confidentiality agreement entered into before or during the execution of the project, their publication could affect the obtaining of an industrial property right, or any other reason prevents their dissemination will be exempt from the deposit obligation, in which case ANID will weigh those reasons and may authorize or not the exclusion for confidentiality.
- If the publications are subject to any type of confidentiality or previous agreements with third parties, the beneficiaries must provide public access to the metadata of these publications and commit to providing open access to the full content of the publication once the obligations affecting that content cease.
- Authors using the “pay to publish” open access option must report to the ANID counterpart the article's DOI at the time of publication to make the deposit in the institutional repository. They must also inform the cost paid to publish and the source of funds that financed the APC fee.

### 5. Open Access Provisions for Research Data

All beneficiaries (researchers and institutions receiving direct or indirect ANID funding) of instruments with current agreements with ANID must present a research data management plan whose purpose is to ensure the public availability of such data.
Agreements will be considered valid if they are signed from the date of the resolution approving this policy.
Beneficiaries must deposit research data in the Agency's repository, in the repositories of the institutions to which the researchers belong, and/or in disciplinary repositories.
The repositories used must comply with standards that guarantee access and safeguarding of such data. They must also be interoperable with the National Agency for Research and Development repository through the OAI-PMH protocol.
If the ANID repository is not used, researchers must inform the ANID counterpart of the URLs or identifiers of the documents and datasets published in other repositories.
The deadline for publishing data in open repositories must not exceed one year after the final report is submitted, even if the respective articles have not been published.

Exempt from these obligations are research data whose publication would be contrary to Law No. 19.628 on the protection of private life, are subject to a confidentiality agreement entered into before or during the execution of the project, their publication could affect the obtaining of an industrial property right, or any other reason prevents their dissemination, in which case ANID will weigh those reasons and may authorize or not the exclusion for confidentiality.

If the research data are subject to any type of confidentiality or previous agreements with third parties, the beneficiaries must provide public access to the metadata of these publications and commit to providing open access to the full content of the publication once the obligations affecting that content cease.

### 6. Effects of Non-compliance

Non-compliance with these obligations will affect project managers in terms of current and future resource transfers from ANID. All resources or claims will be subject to the general rules established in Law No. 19.880, which establishes the bases of administrative procedures governing the acts of state administration bodies.

### 7. Entry into Force and Update

This policy will come into force when the resolution authorizing it is processed. It will be evaluated annually by the Agency's technical instances, which may indicate possible redesigns. Additionally, once in force, it will be submitted bi-annually to a participatory consultation process for its permanent improvement.
