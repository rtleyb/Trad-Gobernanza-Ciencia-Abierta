## DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN

A data management plan is a document that describes the data expected to be generated during a research project. It should indicate how the data will be managed, described, analyzed, and stored, and what mechanisms will be used to share and preserve them. The data management plan evolves as the research progresses.

This Data Management Plan proposal must be submitted to ANID as an annex to the agreement signed by the researcher and/or responsible institution as appropriate. The data management plan must be updated and supplemented each time partial reports and the final report are submitted to ANID.

### A. ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION

### C. HOW THE DATA/RESEARCH RESULTS WILL BE FOUND

#### 1. Indicate the repository you will use to deposit the data and the URL. The repositories to be used must comply with standards that guarantee access and safeguarding of such data. It must also be interoperable with the repository of the National Research and Development Agency using the OAI-HPMH protocol. Example: ANID Repository http://repositorio.anid.cl/; ZENODO https://zenodo.org/

#### 2. Indicate the unique persistent identifier that you will use to find the data stored in a repository. Example: DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3988774, the correct value to be registered will be "10.5281/zenodo.3988774". The value to be registered must always start with "10".
